    <h1>Punjab</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punjab, located
        in the eastern part of Pakistan, is the country's most populous and agriculturally rich province.
        Its capital, Lahore, serves as a cultural, political, and educational hub. The province is known for its fertile
        plains, supported by an extensive irrigation system from rivers like the Indus and its tributaries, making it
        central to Pakistan's agricultural output, including wheat, rice, and cotton. Punjab is also home to a strong
        industrial base, particularly in textiles and manufacturing. Punjabi culture, with its rich traditions,
        festivals, and arts, is widely celebrated, while the region's history is marked by its significance in various
        empires and the Partition of India in 1947. The major cities of Punjab include Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, and
        Multan, each contributing to its diverse cultural and economic landscape.</p>
