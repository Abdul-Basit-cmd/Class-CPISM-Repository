    <h1>Balochistan</h1>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balochistan, the
        largest province by area in Pakistan, is located in the southwest and borders Iran and
        Afghanistan. Despite its vast size, it is sparsely populated, with Quetta as its capital. The province is rich
        in natural resources, including gas, coal, and minerals, contributing significantly to Pakistan's economy.
        However, much of the population relies on agriculture and livestock for livelihood. Balochistan's rugged terrain
        is a mix of mountains, deserts, and coastal areas along the Arabian Sea. The province has a distinct cultural
        identity, with the Baloch people and Pashtuns making up the majority of the population. While Balochi and Pashto
        are widely spoken, Urdu is also understood. Balochistan faces socio-economic challenges, including
        underdevelopment, and has been at the center of political and ethnic tensions in Pakistan. Despite this, it
        holds strategic importance due to projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Gwadar port.
