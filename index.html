    <h1>Pakistan</h1>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pakistan,
        officially known as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a South Asian country bordered by India,
        Afghanistan, Iran, and China, with a coastline along the Arabian Sea. It covers an area of approximately 881,913
        square kilometers and has a population of over 240 million, making it the world's fifth-most populous country.
        Pakistan gained independence from British India on August 14, 1947, under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah,
        with the vision of creating a homeland for Muslims.</p> <br>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country has
        four provinces—Punjab, Sindh, Khyber
        Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan—along with the autonomous regions of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
        Pakistan's diverse landscape includes towering mountain ranges in the north, vast deserts, and fertile plains,
        while its cultural heritage is equally rich, influenced by centuries of Islamic, Persian, and South Asian
        history. The official language is Urdu, though many regional languages are spoken, and the majority of the
        population practices Islam.
